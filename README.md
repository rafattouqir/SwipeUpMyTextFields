# SwipeUpMyUITextFields
Most of the time UITextFields might drop bellow to keyboard, there were many implementations but none worked properly in Swift,
so I've implemented my own to properly work when textfields are needed to be auto scroll up from keyboard with additional padding to give some breathing space to UITextFields.
